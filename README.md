# TurboJet-RUL-Estimation-LSTM
This project aims to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbojet engines using sensor data collected during each cycle and processed by the C-MAPSS software. The analysis involved data from 100 engines, which was cleaned and divided into batches with a specific window size to train an LSTM neural network model.
